    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="left">Dynamics +Gain was founded by me, Mike.
        Im the sole developer of Dynamics +Gain.
    I've been without once in my life. You
    know what the worst part about it is, most people
    don't give a poop. That's where we come in.
    We are aware of the problem of
    disparity and offer a portal for you to donate.
    In addition, we find a whole bunch of
    people who care and allow you to give them money as well.
    Dynamics +Gain is a gateway to all the
    organizations we can find that act on the
    behalf of others and allow you to invest in
        them!</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="left">100% of your donation goes toward the organization you select
    or to Dynamics <strong>+Gain</strong>.
        The organization has signed up and
    has gone through the registration process.</p>

<%--    <p class="center">Here is the exact amount:</p>--%>
<%--    <h4 style="display:inline-block">2.9% + 30&cent; per charge</h4>--%>

<%--    <p class="center">so</p>--%>
<%--    <p class="center">$10 donation would cost 59&cent;</p>--%>

    <h3>What is the Goal?</h3>
    <p class="left">Aside from the obvious one, abolishing homelessness we hope
    to provide gateways or kiosks everywhere in your community allowing
    people to be informed of the problem and contribute on the spot.
    So in essence, information and power to help.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
